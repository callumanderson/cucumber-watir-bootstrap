This is a super simple cucumber test harness using watir-webdriver.
I haven't bothered with anything clever, so you'll need to look through
the env.rb and make sure you have the dependencies installed

To run, navigate to the top level and call cucumber

Useful info:

TODOS:
Add a Rakefile with cucumber task and bundle install so we don't have to worry about dependencies
